# CoredIn - EBC 9 Hackathon Web3Wizards Submission

<img src="./images/CoredIn.png" alt="CoredIn" style="width:300px;"/>

Welcome to **CoredIn**, the new professional SocialFI network built on Coreum!

With CoredIn, all users information is backed by verifiable credentials following the latest standards on **Self-Solvereign identity** while leveraging a custom WASM contract to create an onchain **DID registry** and control data sharing.

On top of that, users are able to **subscribe** to each other profile with a soulbound **smartNFT** minted by **paying a small fee to the profile owner**. Since only generic and anonymous data is stored onchain, subscribed users can **access the actual profile information** and will soon be able to **securely message the profile owner** directly within CoredIn with encrypted onchain messages (WIP - not implemented during the Hackathon).

CoredIn MVP has been developed during the EBC hackathon by a **multidisplicary team from all ages and experiences**.
